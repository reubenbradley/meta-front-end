# Meta Front End Certification Projects

## Introduction

These are the graded labs for the [Front-End Certification Program by Meta](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/meta-front-end-developer). I am making these public in case anyone wants to see what I did. Part of the certification process is that your co-learners review and grade your projects to pass. I am not looking for feedback on these projects, but feel free to do so! I am just sharing them with anyone who is interested.

There are no **peer review** graded projects for the first three courses, so I will not be sharing those. I will be sharing the graded projects for the remaining courses that are peer reviewed as well as the Capstone Project.

You may find these projects less polished than my portfolio projects I may share. I wanted to move through the course as quickly as reasonably possible as I am mainly taking the certification program to document that I do have basic skills and competencies as a web developer.

Thanks so much for looking! Feel Free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/reuben-bradley-3a78478)
