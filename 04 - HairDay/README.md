# About the portfolio project

This sample project is the graded assessment for Course 4 - HTML and CSS in Depth of the Meta Frontend Developer Certification Program.

This project creates a home page for a fictional client. The client you choose will determine what links, pictures and colors you will use. You are free to use your creativity, but the home page needs to meet certain criteria regarding the following:

The header should contain:

- the client logo and
- the main content should be a large promotional banner with
- three columns with text and images below it.

The footer will have two columns:

- the first column should have a small logo and the
- second one should have copywriting information.

When it comes to styling, you're free to create the appropriate look and feel for your client's target audience but the home page needs to meet certain criteria regarding the following:

- Visual layout
- Semantic structure
- CSS layout
- CSS styling
- CSS effects

This is a peer-review project which means that my home page was evaluated by fellow learners.
